## Introduction to Continuous strategies

### Why we use that?

You have a project. You have a team working on this project. Your team deliver some amount of features/per day/per week/ per sprint. All participants of your team want to be sure that your repository contains stable and covered with specs code.

The needs associated with merging code grows every day and you also want some git branch after code base updating being sent to some stage(dev/staging/production e.t.c)

### Under control!

All of these cases could be handled with continuous strategies!

- Continuous integration
- Continuous delivery
- Continuous deployment

### Continuous integration

It's is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day.

Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

### Benefits

- Say goodbye to long and tense integrations
- Increase visibility enabling greater communication
- Catch issues early and nip them in the bud
- Spend less time debugging and more time adding features
- Build a solid foundation
- Stop waiting to find out if your code’s going to work
- Reduce integration problems allowing you to deliver software more rapidly

### Continuous delivery

Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration to make sure that you can release new changes to your customers quickly in a sustainable way. This means that on top of having automated your testing, you also have automated your release process and you can deploy your application at any point of time by clicking on a button.

With continuous delivery, you can decide to release daily, weekly, fortnightly, or whatever suits your business requirements.

### Benefits

- The complexity of deploying software has been taken away. Your team doesn't have to spend days preparing for a release anymore.
- You can release more often, thus accelerating the feedback loop with your customers.
- There is much less pressure on decisions for small changes, hence encouraging iterating faster.

### Continuous deployment

Continuous deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.

It is an excellent way to accelerate the feedback loop with your customers and take pressure off the team as there isn't a **Release Day** anymore. Developers can focus on building software, and they see their work go live minutes after they've finished working on it.

### Benefits

- You can develop faster as there's no need to pause development for releases. Deployments pipelines are triggered automatically for every change.
- Releases are less risky and easier to fix in case of problem as you deploy small batches of changes.
- Customers see a continuous stream of improvements, and quality increases every day, instead of every month, quarter or year.

## Pros and Cons

#### Main CircleCI strength

**Simple UI.** CircleCI is recognized for its user-friendly interface for managing builds/jobs. Its single-page web app is clean and easy to understand
**High-quality customer support.** StackShare’s community members highlight CircleCI’s speedy support: They respond to requests within 12 hours.
CircleCI runs **all types of software tests** including web, mobile, and container environments.
**Caching of requirements installation and third-party dependencies.** Instead of installing the environments, CircleCI can take data from multiple projects using the granular check-out-key options.
**No need for manual debugging.** CircleCI has debugging feature Debug via SSH, but Jenkins users have to debug manually by clicking on jobs.

## Executors and Images

#### Overview

CircleCI enables you to run jobs in one of three environments:

* Within Docker images (docker)
* Within a Linux virtual machine (VM) image (machine)
* Within a macOS VM image (macos)

It is possible to specify a different executor type for every job in your `.circleci/config.yml` by specifying the 
executor type and an appropriate image.
Main differences between using Docker and VM:

| Virtual Environment                        | Docker  | Machine   |
|--------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|
| Start time                                 | Instant | 30-60 sec |
| Clean environment                          | Yes     | Yes       |
| Custom images                              | Yes     | No        |
| Build Docker images                        | Yes     | Yes       |
| Full control over job environment          | No      | Yes       |
| Full root access                           | No      | Yes       |
| Run multiple databases                     | Yes     | Yes       |
| Run multiple versions of the same software | No      | Yes       |
| Layer caching                              | Yes     | Yes       |
| Run privileged containers                  | No      | Yes       |
| Use docker compose with volumes            | No      | Yes       |
| Configurable resources (CPU/RAM)           | Yes     | No        |

The docker key defines Docker as the underlying technology to run your jobs using Docker Containers. 
Containers are an instance of the Docker Image you specify. The first image listed in your configuration is 
the primary container image in which all steps run. All other containers run in a common network and every exposed 
port will be available on localhost from a primary container.

#### Pre-Built CircleCI Docker Images

For convenience, CircleCI maintains several Docker images. These images are typically extensions of official Docker 
images and include tools especially useful for CI/CD. All of these pre-built images are available in the [CircleCI org
on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=circleci&type=image). 

CircleCI’s convenience images fall into two categories: **language images** and **service images**. 
All images add a circleci user as a system user.

#### Language Images

Language images are convenience images for common programming languages. These images include both the relevant 
language and commonly-used tools. A language image should be listed first under the docker key in your configuration, 
making it the primary container during execution.

CircleCI maintains images for the languages below.

* Android
* Clojure
* Elixir
* Go (Golang)
* JRuby
* Node.js
* OpenJDK (Java)
* PHP
* Python
* Ruby
* Rust

#### Language Image Variants

CircleCI maintains several variants for language images. To use these variants, add one of the following suffixes 
to the end of an image tag.

* `-node` includes Node.js for polyglot applications
* `-browsers` includes Chrome, Firefox, Java 8, and Geckodriver
* `-browsers-legacy` includes Chrome, Firefox, Java 8, and PhantomJS
* `-node-browsers` combines the -node and -browsers variants
* `-node-browsers-legacy` combines the -node and -browsers-legacy variants

#### Service Images

Service images are convenience images for services like databases. These images should be listed after language images 
so they become secondary service containers.

CircleCI maintains images for the services below.

* buildpack-deps
* DynamoDB
* MariaDB
* MongoDB
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Redis

#### Sample Configuration

```yml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/ruby:2.5.1-node
      - image: circleci/postgres:9.6
      - image: redis
```
